@subsection Overview

This document describes the symbol library and @netlist{} backend
which support driving RF Cascade
(@url{http://rfcascade.sourceforge.net}) simulations from the Lepton
system.  Cascade is a noise figure and distortion analysis tool geared
towards radio receiver design.

The basic steps involved with using Lepton as the frontend for Cascade
simulations are:
@enumerate
@item
Create schematics of the circuit.

@item
Extract the netlist.

@item
Run Cascade.

@end enumerate


@subsection Requirements

You will need the following programs to be installed:
@itemize
@item lepton-eda
A version of Lepton package.

@item RF Cascade
The executable is usually called @command{cascade}.  If you do not
have Cascade available on your system, you will need to get a copy
from @url{http://rfcascade.sourceforge.net}.

@end itemize


@subsection Creating Schematics

When creating a block diagram in the @schematic{} editor, use only the
symbols from the cascade library.  Every block diagram must have a
@samp{cascadesource} element.  In addition, the block diagram must be a
simple cascade.  No parallel paths or branches are allowed.

All instances must have a unique reference designator.  For a receiver
block diagram, this is often times best achieved by manually entering
them.  The only restriction on reference designator names is that they
contain no spaces.  A descriptive name such as @samp{RF Filter} or
@samp{First Mixer} is useful as it will show up in the cascade output
report.


@subsection Extracting the Cascade Input File

To extract the Cascade input file, run:
@example
lepton-netlist -g cascade -o test.cas file1.sch [file2.sch ...]
@end example

For the example file contained in this archive, you can run:
@example
lepton-netlist -g cascade -o example.cas example.sch
@end example

The netlist will be left in @file{example.cas}.


@subsection Running Cascade

Cascade is exceptionally simple to run.  Just run:
@example
cascade example.cas > example.out
@end example

to run the analysis on the system contained in the file
@file{example.cas} and write the results to the file
@file{example.out}.  Refer to the Cascade documentation for complete
details.


@subsection Appendix A -- Symbols in the Library

Please note that all instances must have the @samp{refdes=} attribute
set.


@subsubsection Sources (cascade-source)

Source.

Attributes:
@itemize
@item
C=Carrier level in dBm.  Optional.

@item
CN0=Carrier to Noise Spectral Density Ratio in dBm/Hz.  Optional.

@item
CN=Carrier to Noise Ratio in dB.  Optional.

@item
BW=Signal Bandwidth in Hz.  Optional, but requred if CN= is used.

@end itemize


@subsubsection Defaults (cascade-default)

This symbol sets the default impedance levels as well as the
correlation coeffcient used for third order distortion calculations.
There are two versions of this symbol.  One is used to set the
defaults at the beginnng of the definition.  The other can be placed
in series with the cascade to change the defaults part way through.
This is useful if you wish to change impedance levels in the middle of
the receiver chain.  Attributes:

@itemize
@item
RIN=Default block input resistance in Ohms.  Optional.

@item
ROUT=Default block output resistance in Ohms.  Optional.

@item
RHO=Default third order distortion correlation coeffcient.  Optional.

@end itemize


@subsubsection Elements

Cascade characterizes each block in a system by its gain and
optionally noise figure and third order intercept point.  As such,
there is no distinction between various elements such as amplifiers,
filters, and mixers.  The Lepton RF Cascade symbol library contains
different symbols for clarity in the diagram only.  The currently
available element symbols are:

Attributes:

@subsection Example

This appendix provides a simple example of the entire process of
generating a schematic, producing a Cascade input file, running an
analysis and looking at the result.

@ref{fig:cascade1} shows the schematic of a simple receiver signal
chain.
